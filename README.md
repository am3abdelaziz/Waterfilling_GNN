# Waterfilling_GNN

Welcome to the Waterfilling_GNN repository!

This is a sample exercise for using machine learning to approximate the well known waterfilling algorithm

## How to Use

To explore the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `Waterfilling_GNN.ipynb`.

That's it! You can now read and run the Jupyter Notebook to understand the implementation of the Waterfilling algorithm with Graph Neural Networks for wireless communications.
